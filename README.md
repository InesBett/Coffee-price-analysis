# â˜• The Price of a Cup: Does Coffee Production Influence Affordability?

## Project Overview

Welcome to my final project, a comprehensive analysis of coffee consumption, pricing, and production levels across different countries! This project marks the culmination of my journey in Ironhack's Data Analytics Bootcamp, where I apply the skills and knowledge I've gained to showcase my progress in data analysis, visualization, and storytelling.

## Project Goal

This analysis explores whether coffee-producing countries (Brazil, Colombia, Ethiopia) have lower coffee prices compared to non-producing countries (Luxembourg, Finland). It also investigates how coffee production levels influence affordability and incorporates sentiment analysis to gain further insights.

## The Dataset ðŸ“Š

The dataset used in this project includes:

Coffee consumption and pricing data across multiple countries

Production levels of key coffee-producing nations

Sentiment analysis results from a questionnaire I created

Additional economic indicators for further context

## Methods & Tools Used âš™

To conduct this analysis, I used:

SQL for querying and extracting relevant insights

Python for data cleaning, manipulation, and statistical analysis

Tableau to create interactive visualizations

Streamlit to develop an app for showcasing results

Sentiment Analysis to understand consumer perspectives on coffee pricing and accessibility

## Data Visualizations ðŸ“ˆ

I generated insightful visualizations using Python libraries, Tableau dashboards, and the Streamlit app to effectively communicate findings. Key visualizations include:

Price comparisons between coffee-producing and non-producing countries

Correlation analysis between production levels and affordability

Sentiment trends from questionnaire responses

## Streamlite 

To further enhance the interactivity of the project, I created a Streamlit app that displays the visualizations and allows users to dive deeper into the data. The app integrates real-time SQL queries with the visual insights, offering a seamless exploration experience.

## Final Thoughts ðŸŽ¯

This project represents the culmination of my learning journey, where I have applied advanced data analytics techniques to uncover meaningful insights. Through this analysis, I aim to demonstrate not only my technical capabilities but also my ability to tell a compelling data-driven story.

Special thanks to my Ironhack instructors for their guidance throughout this experience!
