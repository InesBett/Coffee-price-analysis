    The **sharp decline from 2020 to 2022** suggests that coffee production, or related metrics, faced significant challenges during this period.  
    This could be attributed to the **global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic**, which disrupted several key aspects of the coffee supply chain:  

    - **Labor Shortages**: Lockdowns and travel restrictions reduced the availability of farm labor in major coffee-producing countries like **Brazil, Colombia, and Ethiopia**, where harvesting heavily relies on manual work.  
    - **Logistics Disruptions**: Shipping delays, increased storage costs, and reduced market accessibility made it difficult for small-scale producers to export coffee.  
    - **Decline in Consumption**: With cafes and restaurants closed during lockdowns, **out-of-home coffee consumption dropped significantly**.  
    - **Financial Struggles**: Rising production costs and financial challenges further hindered production capacity.  

    From **2022 onward, a strong recovery is observed**, peaking in **2024**, likely due to a return to stability in the coffee industry.  
    However, a **slight decline in 2025** might be due to **limited available data**, as the figures for this year only include early data.

    Since the p-value is greater than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ). This suggests that there isn't enough evidence to say that coffee is cheaper in coffee-producing countries compared to non-producing countries.

    The **negative t-statistic** (-0.39) suggests that coffee prices might be slightly lower in producing countries, but the difference is minimal. The **p-value of 0.3485** indicates a high probability that the observed result could have occurred by chance, rather than being a true effect of the coffee production status on prices.

    **Why this happens:**
    - Many coffee-producing countries, especially those with high-quality beans like Brazil and Colombia, export a significant portion of their coffee, which can drive up domestic prices due to export demand.
    - Non-producing countries may have higher import taxes, but their efficient supply chains or subsidies could stabilize or lower prices.
    - Local factors such as transportation costs and varying demand can influence prices in producing countries, especially in remote areas.
    - Non-producing countries like Luxembourg and Finland may have a mix of budget and premium coffee options, balancing out average prices. Additionally, wealthier populations in these countries may be willing to pay more for specialty coffee, affecting overall pricing.
